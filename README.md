## Overview
This web application, built using the Flask framework for Python, serves as an online shop homepage. It features a navigation bar, header section, and product listings with images, prices, and various actions such as adding items to the cart. The styling is done using Bootstrap, including its icons and CSS styles. The application utilizes templates, such as 'index.html', for rendering dynamic content. Additionally, static files are incorporated for assets like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript scripts. In summary, this Flask application provides a simple and visually appealing interface for users to navigate through a fictional online shop, view product details, and interact with a shopping cart.
